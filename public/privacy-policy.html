          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <h3>Notice of Privacy Practices</h3>
          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          Singh Medical Supplies is committed to protecting the privacy of our
          employees, our customers, and their employees. This means that we
          process data about identified or identifiable individuals, which is
          called personal data, with due care and in accordance with applicable
          data protection law.<br /><br />
          This Privacy Notice describes how Singh Medical Supplies, supported by
          its worldwide affiliated companies, processes personal data collected
          from individuals in relation to their enrollment in our programs, use
          of our websites, product orders, and attendance at events
          (collectively, our “Services”). In legal terms, we are the data
          controller, as we determine the means and/or purposes of the
          processing data collected in these circumstances.<br /><br />
          This Privacy Notice only covers data processing carried out by Singh
          Medical Supplies. The Privacy Notice does not address, and we are not
          responsible for, the privacy practices of any third parties, also in
          cases where Services include hyperlinks to third parties’ websites or
          when cookies are set by third parties.
          <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
          <span>Personal Data</span><br />
          The personal data we collect from individuals using our Services
          mostly consists of customer data, such as name, address, telephone
          number, email address and other personal data that identifies,
          describes or is reasonably capable of being associated with you.<br /><br />
          <span>Technical Data</span><br />
          When you use our websites we may also collect technical data in
          relation to Users, such as IP address, browser type and version,
          preferred language, geographic location, operating system and computer
          platform, the full URL clickstream to, through and from our Services,
          including date and time, websites accessed immediately before and
          after visiting our websites, services Users viewed or searched for
          while using our Services, and parts of our Services that Users have
          visited. Although we do not normally use technical data to identify
          individuals, sometimes individuals can be recognized from it, either
          alone or when combined or linked with user data. In such situations,
          technical data can also be considered to be personal data under
          applicable law, and we will treat the combined data as personal
          data.<br /><br />
          <span>Cookies</span><br />
          We use various technologies to collect and process technical data in
          relation to Users, including cookies. Cookies are small text files
          stored on Users’ computer by the internet browser. Cookies allow us to
          calculate the aggregate number of people using our Services and
          monitor the use of our Services. This helps us to improve our Services
          and better serve our Users. We may also use cookies that make the use
          of the Services easier, for example by remembering usernames,
          passwords and preferences. We may use tracking and analytics cookies
          to see how well our Services are being received by our Users. Some
          cookies enable our Services to function and inform us whether our
          Services are functioning properly. Our advertising cookies allow us to
          deliver targeted advertising to people who visit our websites (online
          behavioral advertising OBA). Users may choose to disable cookies or
          change their browser settings to alert when cookies are being sent.
          Information about how to manage cookies can be found online. Some
          parts of our Services may not function properly if Users prefer not to
          accept the use of cookies.<br /><br />
          <span>Google Analytics</span><br />
          We use a tool called “Google Analytics” to collect information about
          use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how
          often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so,
          and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. We use
          the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this
          site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on
          the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other
          identifying information. We do not combine the information collected
          through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable
          information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on
          your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you
          visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.
          Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google
          Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google
          Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You can prevent
          Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by
          disabling cookies on your browser.<br /><br />
          <span>Purposes</span><br />
          We process personal data for the following purposes:<br />
          <ul>

              and special offers that are likely to interest them,
            </li>
            <li>
              to allow us to perform the contract we have signed with our
              customers, suppliers or partners, to allow customer service
              management, e.g. when Users contact our service desk,
            </li>
            <li>
              to allow contract management, e.g. to address our invoices to our

          </ul>
          <br />
          In consideration of the collection and processing for the purposes
          listed above, Singh Medical Supplies is supported by its affiliated
          companies acting as data processors on behalf of and under the
          responsibility of Singh Medical Supplies<br /><br />
          Should the personal data be provided to us via our prospect, customer,
          supplier or partner, we shall assume that our prospect, customer,
          supplier or partner has informed the individual of this Privacy
          Notice.<br /><br />
          <span>Storage Period</span><br />
          We do not store the personal data for longer than is legally permitted
          and necessary for the related processing purposes. The storage period
          depends on the type of personal data, the purposes and the applicable
          law and therefore varies per use.<br /><br />
          Typically, we store User’s personal data for as long as the User is
          using our Services or for as long as we have another purpose to do so
          and, thereafter, for no longer than is required or permitted by law or
          necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes.<br /><br />
          We erase personal data after the above described storage period or
          when the User requests us to erase his/her personal data.<br /><br />
          <span>Legitimate Grounds for Processing</span><br />
          We process personal data to pursue our legitimate interest to run,
          maintain and develop our business. Furthermore, we process personal
          data to comply with our legal obligations. In some parts of our
          Services, we might request Users’ consent for the processing of their
          personal data for specific purposes. In that event, Users may withdraw
          their consent at any time.<br />
          <h3>Rights of Users</h3>
          <span>Right to access.</span> Any User may contact us to get
          confirmation as to whether or not we are processing User’s personal
          data. Where we do process User’s personal data, we will inform User of
          what categories of personal data we process regarding him/her, the
          processing purposes, the categories of recipients to whom personal
          data have been or will be disclosed and the envisaged storage period
          or criteria to determine that period.<br /><br />
          <span>Right to withdraw consent.</span> In case our processing is
          based on a consent granted by the User, the User may withdraw the
          consent at any time by contacting us or by using the functionalities
          of our Services. Withdrawing a consent may lead to fewer possibilities
          to use our Services.<br /><br />
          <span>Right to rectification.</span> Any User has the right to have
          inaccurate or incomplete personal data we store about the User
          rectified or completed.Right to object. In case our processing is
          based on our legitimate interest to run, maintain and develop our
          business, any User has the right to object at any time to our
          processing. We shall then no longer process User’s personal data
          unless for the provision of our Services or if we demonstrate other
          compelling legitimate grounds for our processing that override User’s
          interests, rights and freedoms or for legal claims. Notwithstanding
          any consent granted beforehand for direct marketing purposes, any User
          has the right to prohibit us from using his/her personal data for
          direct marketing purposes, by contacting us or by using the
          functionalities of the Services or unsubscribe possibilities in
          connection with our direct marketing messages.<br /><br />
          <span>Right to restriction of processing.</span> Any User has the
          right to obtain from us restriction of processing of User’s personal
          data, as foreseen by applicable data protection law, e.g. to allow our
          verification of accuracy of personal data after User’s contesting of
          accuracy or to prevent us from erasing personal data when personal
          data are no longer necessary for the purposes but still required for
          User’s legal claims or when our processing is unlawful. Restriction of
          processing may lead to fewer possibilities to use our Services.<br /><br />
          <span>Right to data portability.</span> Any User has the right to
          receive User’s personal data from us in a structured, commonly used
          and machine-readable format and to independently transmit those data
          to a third party, in case our processing is based on User’s consent
          and carried out by automated means.<br /><br />
          <span>Right to erasure.</span> Any User has the right to have personal
          data we process about the User erased from our systems if the personal
          data are no longer necessary for the related purposes, if we have
          unlawfully processed the personal data or if the User objects to
          processing for direct marketing. Any User furthermore has the right to
          erasure if the User withdraws consent or objects to our processing as
          meant above, unless we have a legitimate ground to not erase the data.
          We may not immediately be able to erase all residual copies from our
          servers and backup systems after the active data have been erased.
          Such copies shall be erased as soon as reasonably possible.<br /><br />
          How to use these rights. To exercise any of the above-mentioned
          rights, User should primarily use the functions offered by our
          Services. If such functions are however not sufficient for exercising
          such rights, Customer shall send us a letter or email to the address
          set out below under Contact, including the following information:
          name, address, phone number, email address and a copy of a valid proof
          of identity. We may request additional information necessary to
          confirm User’s identity. We may reject requests that are unreasonably
          repetitive, excessive or manifestly unfounded.<br /><br />
          <h3>Keeping Your Data Secure</h3>
          We implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and
          organizational security measures to protect the personal data we
          process, from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, loss or
          destruction.<br /><br />
          We regularly audit the application of our security measures and we ask
          third party experts to review our security controls against
          international standards. These audits help us to further improve our
          security level.<br /><br />
          The personal information we collect is transferred over a secure
          connection and stored on a secure server to ensure your privacy. Your
          personal information will not be publicly available unless required by
          law. Access to your account for program enrollment or on-line
          purchases is controlled by a user name and password that are unique to
          you.<br /><br />
          Should, despite our security measures, a security breach occur that is
          likely to result in a risk to the data privacy of Users, we will
          inform the relevant Users and other affected parties, as well as
          relevant authorities when required by applicable data protection law,
          about the security breach as soon as reasonably possible.<br /><br />
          <h3>Recipients</h3>
          We only share personal data within our organization, if and as far as
          necessary, for the purposes specified in this Privacy Notice. Our
          staff members processing personal data are bound to confidentiality.
          We do not share personal data with any third party outside of our
          organization unless one of the following circumstances applies.<br /><br />
          <span>Necessary for the purposes.</span> We may share personal data
          with third parties to the extent our Services foresee such disclosure
          and Users submit their personal data for that purpose, such as through
          an address book to create connections and facilitate our Services. We
          may furthermore share personal data with our affiliated companies and
          other service providers that support us in the realization of the
          purposes specified in this Privacy Notice, such as by performing data
          hosting, direct marketing and customer services. Our agreements with
          these service providers foresee privacy and security commitments from
          these service providers that are no less protective than our own
          commitments described in this Privacy Notice. If our Users provide
          personal data directly to a third party, such as through a link on our
          website, the processing is typically based on such third party’s
          notice.<br /><br />
          <span>For legal reasons.</span> We may share personal data with third
          parties if we have good-faith belief that their access to and use of
          the personal data is necessary (i) to meet any applicable law and/or
          court order, (ii) to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud,
          security or technical issues, and/or (iii) to protect the interests,
          properties or safety of us, our Users or the public, in accordance
          with the law. We will notify Users about such disclosure, as far as
          reasonably possible.<br /><br />
          <span>In relation to corporate restructuring.</span> If we are in a
          process of merger, acquisition or asset sale, we may transfer personal
          data to the involved third party. We continue to ensure the
          confidentiality of all personal data.<br /><br />
          <span>Upon User’s consent.</span> We may share personal data with
          third parties for other reasons than the ones mentioned above, if we
          obtained User’s explicit consent to do so. The User has the right to
          withdraw this consent at any time.<br /><br />
          <span>Location and Transfer</span>
          We and our service providers have operations in several locations.
          Consequently, we and our service providers may transfer personal data
          to, or access it from, countries outside User’s country of domicile.
          We take steps to ensure that Users’ personal data receives an adequate
          level of protection in the countries in which we process it.<br /><br />
          <h3>Lodging a Complaint</h3>
          In case any User considers our processing of his/her personal data to
          be inconsistent with applicable data protection law, a complaint may
          be lodged with the local supervisory authority for data protection.<br /><br />
          <h3>Changes</h3>
          This Privacy Notice is dated January 1, 2021. We may update this
          Privacy Notice at any time if required in order to reflect changes in
          our data processing practices, in personal data protection laws or
          otherwise. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any
          time by posting revisions on the Singh Medical Supplies web site. We
          encourage you to periodically review the privacy policy for any
          modifications. The English version of this Privacy Notice shall govern
          in the event of any conflict with or substantial translation changes
          into a non-English language.
